     <center><p>Our thesis statement is the introductory of our ideas and points to be made: 'The suppressed voices of the young that impede their development are being driven by adults who believe their perspective is correct, resulting in toxic relationships and trauma; teens and adults take on this statut in a researrch through survey.'</p></center>
     <br>
     <center><p>We also have our research questions which are the following:<br>1. Find among the three of the most essential factors influencing youth's voices, and how does it impede their development?<br>2. In comparison to other toxic settings like friends and self-esteem, how did adults come to be one of the most prevalent factors that impact youth?<br>3.

  In this research,  qualitative research is the most appropriate research design to be used. The researchers used the method of survey in gathering the data and findings for this study.  Then, by doing the survey the questions might take the form of yes/no, or rating scale (1 to 5), whereas the quantitative questions would present a box where people can write in their own words. During this survey, we collected a total of 35 Participants including (23 females and 12 males). The potential participants were the students, facilitators, officers and mentees in each Section of APEC schools. Data will be gathered by the researchers to decode in order to come up with the conclusion and recommendation for the whole research. We will be expecting good feedback and sensible knowledge from the personal experience and perspective by the participants for the researchers to have data and findings for the study.</p>

19.4% of the respondents frequently dismiss their own comment because an adult said so.<br><br>

Reasons for being secretive:<br>
The respondents believed it’s because of lack of physical interactions with others, they keep things to themselves because parents do not understand them fully and to avoid being misunderstood. They keep their secret to themselves to avoid being judged by others.<br><br>

Biggest challenges of youths:<br>
The respondents acknowledge stepping up to the ones that disregards them from society, depression, proper learning and social skills.<br><br>

Encouragement for standing up for themselves:<br>
The respondents presume that joining activities that boost their self confidence, sticking to their strength and passion when deciding on a career route, and having full support.<br><br>

Factors Affecting Youth Voice in Decision-Making Processes and Youth Personal Developments:<br>
Bad relationship with family, Mental Health, School stress, Personality, culture, traditions, social media, personal experiences, Peer pressure, opinion of others, lack of confidence, Lack of support, Wrong circle of friends; discouraging, Afraid of failing.<br><br>

The adults who showed consideration believed that teens can be secretive because of how some
adults treat them. They also believed that depression and stepping up for yourself are the challenges that most youths face today and your relationship with your family, mental health, school works, culture & traditions, and mental health can be factors of a teens decision and growth. 2 out of 3 adults are aware of how to invalidate or validate teenagers' opinions. In their opinion, being considerate should go both ways and prevention of being strict and overprotective that is not healthy anymore should be implemented since youth are the hope of our nation and we need their voices to help our society grow. <br><br>

The youths handle failure by letting their emotions out, learning from your mistakes, turning to
God, accepting, distracting themself, and resting for a moment. Most of them believed that a toxic environment, self-esteem, experience,  and mental health can affect their own decisions and growth. They stated that this topic is not brought up more especially in a toxic asian household and this might help teenagers and their family create a healthier environment for themselves. Additionally, they held the idea that young people's thoughts and beliefs aren't actually given much credence since they risk being labeled as "wrong" if they don't coincide with those of adults. They were taught as children that adults are always correct and that they are wiser than children. And they disagree; they believe that everybody, regardless of age, has the potential to be right or wrong.</p>

In a video, a group of teenagers share the things that they could wish to say to their parents. Many concerns of them have been shown on the video but they state that they have the power or chance to totally express or say it to their parents. <br><br>

Reference:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkTec5g1FFE<br><br>

Root cause: Parents are not aware of the impacts on how the teens will be affected if they cannot confidently express their feelings without hesitation to say everything according to their feelings. <br><br>

<div class="content">
  <p>Problem: Why does the suppressed voice of teens affect their personal growth?<br><br>

Why 1: Why does the suppressed voice of teens affect their personal growth?<br>
Because teens these days are secretive they can’t speak for what they stand so they rather keep things to themselves.<br><br>

Why 2: Why would they rather keep things to themselves?<br>
Because of their feeling that their statements must be disregarded<br><br>

Why 3: Why would they feel that their statements must be disregarded? <br>
Because they follow an adult’s belief knowing that they are wrong at some point.<br><br>

Why 4: Why would they follow an adult’s belief knowing that they are wrong.<br>
Because they are aware that adult’s words of standing can invalidate their feelings. <br><br>

Why 5: Why would adult’s words of standing invalidate their feelings? <br>
- Because of the tradition that adults must follow as always as they believe that they always know what's best.<br><br>

Root Cause: Teenagers frequently ignore their own viewpoints because an adult says so, and some of them may also have low self-esteem.

    <center><h2>Part 6: Creating the draft of Chapter 1--The Introduction<br>(English)</h2></center><br><br>
   <center><h3>Background of the study</h3></center>
    <p>”Voices of the youth” is the opinions, different thoughts, views, dispositions, and knowledge that is needed to be expressed by the young. Silencing the youth’s voices occurs when adults strip away teenage people's power to speak which is a factor commonly known by everyone. This occurs immediately, such as when parents order children to remain quiet or take away their communication equipment. It sometimes occurs indirectly, such as when kids want adult approval and elders do not provide it, this usually happens within a toxic household.<br><br>


Adults, as a major role in repressed voices of the young, have an impact on their surroundings and the self-esteem of teens. This factor may be researched utilizing honest surveys and past studies. Using this strategy, researchers are charged with creating questionnaires that correspond with this topic in order to collect data and propose strategies to mitigate it. “The decline of student rights began with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1985 decision in New Jersey v. T.L.O., a Fourth Amendment search and seizure case.” Hudson, D. L. The silencing of student voices - Preserving free speech in America’s schools.<br><br>


Recent studies suggest that adults, specifically parents/guardians and teachers are the fundamental factors in the repressed voices of the young. Toxic households and too often school officials ignore the freedom of students to express significant beliefs, opinions, proposals, and etc. In addition to that, their voices are routinely and consistently removed from numerous discourses, often by mistake, but more often by callous intent and mindless division.<br><br><br>
</p>
   <center><h3>Statement of the Problem and Research Questions</h3></center>
    <p>The study will determine how adults suppress the voice of teens and the other sub-factors as well. We believe that suppressed voices can affect teenager’s personal growth and development because of many factors that can hinder their confidence and self-esteem. Every situation like this begins at home where every child has developed their characteristics and personalities through the family connection and environment. There are some instances that teens cannot voice out their opinions because of the phrases that adults tend to say which validates teenagers feelings. We are used to following an adult’s perspective as it has become tradition already. From the qualitative research and from the initial data from the researchers’ survey, the majority of the Teenager’s felt that their feelings are often felt that their statements are being disregarded commonly because they follow adult’s more and some have low self esteem. <br><br>


This study focuses on this general question: Find among three of the most essential factors influencing youth’s voices, and how does it impede their development? In line with this are these specific questions; In comparison to other toxic settings like friends and self - esteem, how did adults come to be one of the most prevalent factors that impact youth? And to help in providing solutions to our problem we may also ask what are the most effective communication strategies for solving relationships with adults and youths in terms of coinciding and accepting each other’s opinion? All of these three questions will reveal its answers all throughout this research.<br><br><br>
</p>
<center><h3>Significance of the Study</h3></center>
    <p>Teenagers/Students. This study proves that silencing a teenager's voice has an effect on their growth and surroundings. This will help children regain their confidence to speak up for themselves and discover how they might change their interactions with an adult to provide the groundwork for a stronger connection. They can also broaden their perspectives in order to identify and strengthen their own flaws in order to boost their self-esteem. Furthermore, teenagers would obtain effective communication and listening techniques, allowing them to not only build confidence but also overcome obstacles and achieve many possibilities.<br><br>


Parents and Guardians. The outcomes of this research will indicate that it is simpler to interact with a teenager if parents and guardians take the time to listen and communicate properly. This would improve their parenting capabilities and build a closer bond with their children because youth want to express themselves and have someone listen to them. This allows parents and guardians to interact with their children while simultaneously taking care of them.<br><br>


Learning Facilitators. Too frequently, school administrators have overlooked the significance of fundamental rights and freedoms. Effective communication and support for youth also lays the groundwork for teachers to genuinely listen to and respect their students. Learning facilitators will increase their teaching capabilities as a result of this study, as will their ability to handle their pupils without contempt. This will help teachers to easily relate with their students while also teaching them with the use of a proper communication method. <br><br>


Other researchers. This study will contribute to the accumulation of knowledge that others may use as a resource for examining the factors that suppress the voices of the young and impact their personal growth. <br><br><br>
