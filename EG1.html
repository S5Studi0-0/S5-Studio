  <p>There are numerous ways to figure out what content you want to create.

To narrow down your final content, it's best to:</br>
1. Determine your target audience and key message.</br>
2. Brainstorm content ideas.</br>
3. Select a platform and video length.</br>
4. Determine when and how frequently to stream.</br>

<div class="content">
  <p>1. How would you recognize a problem?</br>
We could recognize a problem by analyzing deeply what the problem is. To completely understand the topic, we must go deep below the surface and constantly have an open mind. It would also assist to broaden our attention and concentration in order to identify and characterize the problem.</br></br>


2. In a community or situation, it is impossible to have only one problem. How would you know what problem needs to be dealt with first?</br>
It is impossible to have one problem because I think that it is a domino effect which affects one after another. We could know which problem to be dealt with first by identifying the root problem that affected the others.</br></br>


3. How would you explain the importance of brainstorming ideas with other people to find a solution to a problem?</br>
Two heads are better than one! Ideating concepts with others might result in numerous views and techniques that will be useful and necessary in discovering our resolution.</br></br>


4. How would you use the resources available to solve a problem?</br>
Being resourceful and coming up with more different conclusions about the material necessary can help us find a way to think of the perfect solution with the limited amount of resources. </br></br>


5. What are the considerations you would take to know if your proposed solutions would solve a problem?</br>
We would evaluate our proposed solutions by assessing other choices or approaches and eliminating unhelpful elements. Understanding the concerns can ultimately aid in the evaluation and testing of our approach!
